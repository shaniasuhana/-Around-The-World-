        <p>What is a Solar System?</p>
            <p>The solar system has one star, eight planets, five dwarf planets, at least 290 moons, more than 1.36 million asteroids, and about 4,500 comets. It is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur. Our solar system orbits the galaxy's center at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.
            We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity.</p>
